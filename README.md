# Happy Thoughts&ensp;|&ensp;[View Live &#10555;](https://olle-happy-thoughts-2.netlify.app/)

Twitter like app where you can post your happy thoughts, read others and give them a like. 
React site using the `useEffect` hook to fetch and post data.

Conditionally renders different styles and elements with the ternary operator e.g.
a loading component while fetching the data. 

Time codes added using Moment library.
